Before distributing this application on windows platforms, be sure to copy any 
required dlls from mingw into the distribution folder. You can place these dlls 
next to the exe in the bin folder. However, if you're using the run.bat file to 
launch the game you can/should place all dlls into a lib folder in the same
directory as the run.bat file.

Also, be aware of any licenses these files may be under.
